Crysis 3 is a stunning first-person shooter that puts you in the Nanosuit of Prophet, a super soldier who must fight against the oppressive CELL Corporation and the alien Ceph. The game offers a fluid and flexible gameplay experience that lets you choose between stealth and action, as well as a variety of weapons and abilities.
 
However, some players have encountered a frustrating bug that prevents them from completing the game. The bug occurs during the final boss fight, where the boss becomes invincible and impossible to kill, no matter how much you shoot at it. This bug can ruin your enjoyment of the game and leave you feeling unsatisfied.

Fortunately, there is a simple mod that can fix this bug and let you finish the game. The mod is called Crysis 3 v1.0 Fix 2 Internal All No-DVD [Reloaded], and it was created by a group of crackers who go by the name of Reloaded. The mod replaces some files in your game directory that fix the trigger that causes the bug.
 
To install the mod, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the mod from this link: [https://megagames.com/fixes/crysis-3-v10-fix-2-internal-all-no-dvd-reloaded](https://megagames.com/fixes/crysis-3-v10-fix-2-internal-all-no-dvd-reloaded)
2. Unrar the mod using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Copy over the cracked content to your game <install>Bin32 directory. This will overwrite some existing files, so make sure you back them up first if you want to restore them later.</install>
4. Use a firewall to block all game exes from going online. This will prevent the game from checking for updates or verifying your license.
5. Play the game and enjoy the final boss fight without any bugs.
