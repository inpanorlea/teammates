- Raid the tombs. The challenge tombs are optional, but they reward you with useful skills that will make your gameplay easier or quicker. They are also fun and challenging puzzles that test your wits and reflexes. Don't miss them when you get the notification that one is nearby.
- Switch shoulders with the left stick. This will give you more visibility when you are behind cover and aiming at enemies. It doesn't matter if Lara's weapon is clipping through the wall or not, as long as your crosshairs are aligned with your target.
- Hunt whenever you can. Hunting animals will give you hides that you can use to upgrade your equipment and craft items. You can also collect plants and other resources that will help you make arrows, explosives, and healing items. The Arrow Retrieval skill will let you reclaim arrows from successful kills, but not from misses.
- Don't forget about the Supply Shack. This is a shop in the Soviet Installation hub area where you can buy some equipment with Byzantine coins. You can find these coins scattered around the world or in coin caches. You should check back on the Supply Shack regularly to see if there is anything new or useful for sale.
- Buy the red dot sight for your rifle. This is one of the items you can buy from the Supply Shack, and it will greatly improve your accuracy and headshot rate with your rifle. It will also make aiming easier in dark or foggy areas.
- Unlock the following skills ASAP. Some skills are more useful than others, and you should prioritize them when spending your skill points. Some of the best ones are Avid Learner (more XP from secrets), Finesse (more XP from headshots and stealth kills), Scavenger (more ammo and resources from crates and enemies), Thick-Skinned (more damage resistance), and Rapid Crafting (faster crafting of items during combat).
- Unlock Deadly Force ASAP too. This is a skill that lets you kill enemies instantly with your bow from behind, without having to tap the button repeatedly. This will save you time and ammo, and make stealth kills much easier.
- Distractions only work on the closest guard to them. If you want to lure enemies away from their posts or groups, you can use objects like bottles or cans to create noise. However, this will only attract the attention of the nearest guard to the source of the sound, not all of them. You can use this to isolate enemies and take them out one by one.
